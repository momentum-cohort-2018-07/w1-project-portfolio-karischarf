                "That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want. Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that. All you have to learn here is how to have fun. What the devil. It's important to me that you're happy. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen." -Bob Ross
